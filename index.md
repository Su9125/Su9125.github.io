# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Yeonsu Choi and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science and I plan to graduate at 2027.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4 was one of the projects I will always remember. I learned the basics of modular programming by putting code into different files while working on units.cc and units_functions.cc. Making functions to change units helped me learn how functions work and how to give them values. Adding the number-guessing game to hilo.cc also gave me a chance to practice using conditional statements and user input. This project was both difficult and satisfying, and it was a great way to learn the basics of programming.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 was different for me because it used code to solve problems that can happen in real life. By working on parking.cc and parking_functions.cc, I learned how to use time, day, and position information to make rules for checking parking. It was especially interesting to learn how to use conditional sentences to handle different situations and make sure that user input was correct. This project really stood out because it used real-life examples to show me how code can be useful in real life.
    
* Lab 8
 
    Lab 8 was a unique project that was all about making patterns and figuring out how to score. I used judge.cc and judge_functions.cc to write a program that takes out the highest and lowest numbers to find the average score. This helped me learn more about loops, vectors, and validating data. I learned how to use stacked loops to make patterns with different symbols in pattern.cc. It was interesting to see how small changes to the code could have such a big effect on the results. This lab was a great way for me to get better at handling problems and learning the basics of programming.
